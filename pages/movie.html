         <h2>LOLO (2017)</h2>
         <p style = "text-indent: 6%;"> Out of my sudden obsession with Julie Delpy's direction, this is the second movie I have watched after Two days In Paris. Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed the clear depiction of Lolo's oedipal obsession with his mother, it was, however, illogical to make a comparison between Sabine and Lolo in the end. Lolo, on one hand, could manage to break Violette's marriage with his father, giving enough evidence of the obsession since childhood. Jean-Renè, on the other hand, had a 20 years long marriage. </p>
         <p style = "text-indent: 6%;"> It is wonderful, however, how Lolo confesses his own vices near the end, enlightening Violette. It is hard to digest that it took her this long to identify the root cause of her relationships problems. Had she read "Attached" at an early stage of dating, she might have come across a sensible guy she loved, and not settled for out of fear of being alone and her ageing. It is also interesting to note how Lolo used feminist ideas against Violette. Which brings me to the question that kept poking me throughout the movie: Is being in love against feminism? Is being in charge all the time in every sphere of life makes one feminist? </p>
